## Developers/ Support: Steffan Sornpoa, Wilfred Gumbs, Cassandra Henderson, Karess Motley, Jim Kirkland, Tony Chung

## Project Overview

Frelief is a relief tool that victims of natural disasters use to find relief in severe and deprived situations. Natural disasters like hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, forest fires, and even terrorist attacks take place every day domestically as well as across the globe. With this application, people who are in distressed situations can not only search for the type of relief they need, but through the Google Maps API, be guided by navigation to the relief locations.


Frelief is the solution that puts relief in the hands of people who need it most.
